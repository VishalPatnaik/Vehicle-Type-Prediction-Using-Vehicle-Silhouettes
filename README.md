# Vehicle-Type-Prediction-Using-Vehicle-Silhouettes

The aim is to predict the type of vehicle by fitting and comparing different machine learning algorithms on Vehicle Silhouettes data which contains the measurements of different vehicles such as model cars, vans, and buses. The dataset is taken from OpenML repository at https://www.openml.org/d/54(Vanschoren, 2021). This data is cleaned using pre-processing techniques in Phase 1 and the resulted data is taken here for further analysis. It contains one target variable and 18 descriptive numerical features.
